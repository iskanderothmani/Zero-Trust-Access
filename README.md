# Zero Trust Access Control

A demonstration policy evaluator for least-privilege access decisions based on identity verification, device posture, MFA, and resource sensitivity.

## Problem and solution
Security teams need repeatable triage that is explainable, auditable, and safe to test. This repository provides a small local-first prototype with transparent rules and synthetic examples.

## Features
- Return explicit allow/deny decisions with reasons
- Require MFA and compliant device posture for sensitive resources
- Apply least-privilege role checks
- Demonstration only—not an identity provider or production authorization service

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Standard library only

## Quick start
```bash
python app.py
```
Some tools accept a file or directory path; run `python app.py` without arguments to see usage where applicable.

## Safety and scope
This is an educational proof of concept, not a production security control. Test only with systems, files, and data you own or are authorized to assess. Do not commit credentials, personal information, real incident logs, or confidential company data. Findings are heuristic and require human validation.

## Roadmap
- Add automated unit tests and CI
- Add structured logging and configuration
- Add signed sample datasets and richer reporting
- Validate against documented test cases before production use
